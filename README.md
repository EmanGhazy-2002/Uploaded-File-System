## Features

- Multi-file upload support
- File type validation (supports `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, and `png` formats)
- File size limit (40KB maximum per file)
- Error handling for unsupported file types, large file sizes, and upload issues
- Automatic creation of the upload directory if it doesn't exist
- Simple GUI for a user-friendly upload experience

## Code Overview

- **`multiUpload.php`**: The main PHP file that handles file uploads, validates file size and type, and saves files to the `/uploaded/` directory.
- **CSS (styles.css)**: A separate stylesheet that defines basic styles for the upload form, error, and success messages to enhance user experience.

## File Validation Rules

- **Allowed File Types**: `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `png`
- **Maximum File Size**: 40KB per file

## Error Handling

The script validates and handles the following errors:
- **File Size Error**: Displays an error if a file exceeds 40KB.
- **File Type Error**: Displays an error if the file type is unsupported.
- **File Upload Error**: Displays a message if no file is selected or if an error occurs during upload.

## GUI and Styling

The user interface has been enhanced with a simple CSS-based design:
- **styles.css**: Provides a cleaner, more user-friendly look with error and success message styling, as well as general styling for the upload form and buttons.
